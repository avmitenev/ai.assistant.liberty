## Liberty Life Assurance - History

Liberty was founded in 1957 by Sir Donald Gordon who saw his father work hard all his life but reap little financial reward. This ignited in him the unstoppable belief that everyone should have the opportunity to grow their wealth and leave a proud legacy for their family. This belief is captured in our very name, Liberty, which represents freedom and opportunity. In Kenya, we have a proud heritage of over half a century. Liberty Life Kenya has been a pioneer in knowledge sharing and making a significant contribution to the financial services industry.
