## What Do You Need To File A Claim?

Navigating the insurance claim process requires precision and clarity. For our customers, being prepared with the right documentation enables us to have the fastest claims process in Kenya. This article outlines the five essential documents to streamline your claim process efficiently and effectively.

1. **Completed Claim Form:** This is the first step in initiating your claim. A claim form specific to the type of insurance (which you can find under the product page or from your Financial Advisor) must be accurately filled out.
2. **Policy Document:** Your insurance policy document is critical to your claim. It serves as proof of the insurance contract between you and the insurer. The policy document outlines your coverage details, policy terms, and conditions.
3. **Official Identification:** This step is vital in preventing fraud and confirming that an authorized individual is filing the claim.
4. **Proof of Loss or Incident:** When filing a claim, it's vital to provide any documentation that can serve as evidence of the incident or loss.
5. **Additional Supporting Documents (As Applicable):** You may need to provide additional supporting documents for your claim, depending on its nature.

Being well-prepared with these documents can expedite your claim process. We are always available to discuss any specific documentation requirements about your policy.
