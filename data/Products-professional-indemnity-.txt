Who should consider Professional Indemnity Insurance?

Technically anyone who could be held liable for a client’s misfortune as a direct consequence of their services might want to consider professional indemnity insurance. The chances of this are greatest for legal, financial, and medical professionals, for which these categories are required by law to have professional indemnity insurance.

Is Professional Indemnity Insurance compulsory?

Professional Indemnity Insurance is not mandatory under the law, but, as mentioned above, the rules of some regulators and professional bodies mean it is compulsory for some professions, such as lawyers, financial advisers, accountants, Doctors, Insurance Brokers, Trustees and architects.

How many years should I take out run off Cover for?

If an insured ceases to operate their business, then run off cover will indemnify them for any unknown claims, occurring during the period of run-off, arising from mistakes made whilst they were still in business. It does depend upon the retroactive date offered with the Policy.
