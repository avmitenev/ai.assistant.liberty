## Fidelity Guarantee

### What is a Fidelity Guarantee Cover

Fidelity Guarantee is a cover that offers protection against loss of money or goods from business premises, through dishonest/fraudulent acts of employee. Cover can be arranged for named positions or on all employees of the insured. This is a very important cover, as most insurance policies will exclude theft by employees/servants.
