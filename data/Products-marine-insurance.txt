### The Law and Marine Insurance Cover in Kenya

In the 2016/2017 budget statement the Minister for Finance directed KRA (Kenya Revenue Authority) to ensure compliance with the Insurance Act Section 20, that requires placement of Kenyan Insurance business locally.

Following various consultative meetings between Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KMA), Association of Kenya Insurers (AKI) and other Stake holders, an implementation process was agreed upon and a roll out date of 1st Jan, 2017.

KENTRADE was appointed as the Implementing Agency through their Single Window system.

The following was agreed upon as the implementation process:-

* All importers are required to register on the Ken Trade Portal (Single Window System) through the assistance of their clearing agents or directly.
* Insured to select preferred insurer from the list uploaded in the Ken trade system, it is assumed the client will have engaged with the insurer or agent before hand to know the pricing offered.
* Once the importer has Keyed in their Personal details, and select preferred insurer from the list uploaded in the Ken trade system, the application is submitted online. The Underwriter will get an e- alert on the request upon which officers from the Insurer will verify the details in the Ken trade system and provide details of Premium, certificate number , stamp duty and other details
* Once the Insurer approves, the system will auto generate the Marine Cargo Insurance certificate (MCI) for clearing purposes and will have details of the officers from the Insurance company. All Insurers have provided details of their officers to Ken trade

Early in January it was possible to clear goods using the Manual Marine certificates, since most importers and clearing agents had not been assigned password in Ken Trade , however, as from mid of Jan, 2017 no imports initiated from 1st Jan are being cleared without the online certificate.

### CUSTOMER REGISTRATION PROCESS IN KENTRADE

The following are the Key steps in the registration process:-

* Either the Importer or their Clearing agent can register Shipment in the Portal
* The Importer will be required to contact Ken trade for registration and training, they can be contacted via Contactcentre@kentrade.go.ke or Tel. 4965000
* Upon the Importer acquiring the access Credentials they will be required to capture details of each shipment in the portal and indicate the insurance company they are working with and intermediary where applicable. 
* Insurer/Underwriter will compute Premium and approve the online requisition.
* The Importer & Insurer can view and Print online certificate which can be presented to customs for Clearance of goods

NB: It is Important to note that only Marine Cargo Insurance certificates, issued through Ken Trade Portal are Valid for Cargo clearance by KRA officials.
