**Can I insure my sister’s or brother’s child?**

Yes & No. Only a blood parent or a legal guardian is allowed to insure a child under his/her policy. Therefore, the assured parent who is a registered legal guardian of his brother’s or sister’s child/children can include them in their Soma Savings Plan cover along with their blood children or take out separate policies for each.

**Who can be insured under a policy held by a parent/guardian?**

Own and legally adopted children only.

**What happens if I am not able to continue paying the premiums?**

* The life assured may opt to voluntarily terminate the policy before maturity and withdraw the surrender value (the policy's value at termination).
* Alternatively, the insured may opt to reduce the sum insured in proportion to the premium he can pay and vice versa.

**Do I get a discount if I pay a lump sum premium?**

Yes, discounts will apply depending on the frequency of premium payment.

**What are the options for parents and guardians regarding cover?**

The options available are as follows:

a) Select another child to be added to the policy or, in case of a policy covering multiple children, it will remain in force for the other children.

b) If no other child can be selected, then all premiums contributed shall be refunded to the parent, or the policy surrender value, whichever is higher, will be payable to the insured parent/guardian on maturity.
