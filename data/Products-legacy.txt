**What other beenfits are payable?**

**1. Accidental Benefit**

If the main member or spouse is involved in an accident, there is a possibility that their livelihood will be seriously compromised. Should this happen, family members will be distraught and burdened financially as accidents are often associated with high costs.

This benefit is designed to contribute towards medical expenses and caters for a loss of income if you or your spouse are unable to work. The accidental benefit covers you and your spouse for both accidental disability and accidental loss of life.

**1.1. Accidental Disability Benefit**

100% of the benefit level selected will be paid on the following conditions:

* Permanent loss of sight in both eyes
* Permanent loss of hearing in both ears
* Permanent loss of speech
* Loss of use of two or more limbs (including paraplegia, diplegia and hemiplegia)
* Major burns

50% of the benefit level selected will be paid on the following conditions:

* Permanent loss of sight in one eye
* Permanent loss of hearing in one ear
* Loss of use of one limb (includes other forms of diplegia)
* Amputation of all fingers, including thumbs on both hands
* Amputation of all toes, including big toes on both feet

**1.2. Accidental Loss of Life Benefit**

If the main member or spouse dies due to an accident, an additional amount, equal to the cover selected, is payable.

For example: If you have selected cover for Ksh. 100.000, an additional Ksh. 100,000 will be paid out if death is due to an accident.
